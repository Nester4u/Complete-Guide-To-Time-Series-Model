# Complete-Guide-To-Time-Series-Model

A collection of data points gathered or recorded at predetermined intervals of time is called a time series. Time series models are mathematical and statistical instruments for analyzing and forecasting time series data. In many disciplines, including finance, economics, meteorology, and many more, time series analysis is essential. Find below an overview of time series models, including its elements and standard methods for time series data analysis.
## 1.	Introduction to Time Series Data.
A collection of observations or measurements gathered or kept track of throughout time is called a time series. These data points are arranged in chronological sequence, and the analysis heavily relies on the time component. 

### Important Features of Time Series Data:
- Dependency on Time: Data points rely on the values they have held in the past.

- Seasonality: Recurring patterns at set times.

- Long-term rising or downward movements are called trends.

- Noise: Irregularity: Unpredictable oscillations

- Why Time Series Analysis Is Important:
Making predictions, recognizing trends, and deriving valuable insights from historical data all depend on time series analysis. It has uses in economics, finance, climate science, and other fields.

## 2.	Components of Time Series.

### Trend
- A time series long-term movement is represented as a trend. It offers perceptions into the underlying dynamics of the data and might be either upward (growth) or downward (fall).

### Time of Year
- Recurring patterns in the data at regular intervals—daily, weekly, or yearly—are referred to as seasonality. Comprehending seasonality aids in the creation of short-term forecasts.

### Sounds
- A time series' random and unexpected component is called noise, or irregularity. It may make identifying underlying patterns difficult.

## 3.	Stationarity

When a time series' statistical characteristics, including its mean and variance, remain constant across time, it is said to be stationary. Prediction and modeling are made easier by stationarity.
Results from non-stationary data may not be trustworthy. In time series modeling, stationarity is a widely accepted assumption.
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and visual examination of data plots are typical tests.

## 4.	Time Series Models

### Models of Autoregressive (AR)
- Lagged values from the time series are used by AR models to generate predictions. P-lag values are used in AR(p) models.

### Models of Moving Averages (MA)
- MA models project future values based on historical forecast errors. Forecast errors are q lagged in MA(q) models.

### ARIMA Models: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
- ARIMA creates a stationary time series by combining the AR and MA components with differencing. p AR terms, d differences, and q MA terms are used in ARIMA(p, d, q) models.

### Time Series Seasonal Decomposition (STL)
- To facilitate modeling, STL breaks down a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

### Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
- Exponentially weighted averages of historical observations are taken into account by exponential smoothing (ETS) models. ETS(AAA), ETS(AAM), and other ones are among them.

## 5.	Model Selection and Estimation

### ACF and PACF
- The order of AR and MA terms can be ascertained using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation charts.


### Calculating Parameters
- Utilizing techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), determine the model's parameters.


### Evaluation of Models
- Analyze models with out-of-sample validation and information criteria (AIC, BIC).

## 6.	Forecasting with Time Series Models

### Single-Step-Ahead Prediction
- Make a single-step prediction about the future.

### Multiple-Step Prediction
- Forecast several stages ahead of time.

### Metrics for Forecast Accuracy
- To assess the accuracy of a forecast, use measures such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## 7.	Advanced Time Series Model

### Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
- An extension of ARIMA that takes into account the seasons.

### Autoregression Vectors (VAR)
- Utilized for modeling data from multivariate time series.

### Moving-Average Vector Autoregression (VARMA)
- Integrates the components of MA and VAR for multivariate time series.

### Time Series Seasonally Decomposed with Trend and Seasonal Components (STL-ETS)
- A method for modeling time series with trend and seasonality that combines STL and ETS.
